Project Name Ebook Store(The Final Captsone Project)

The project displays my understanding of using python code and functions together with sql concepts to create a program
that uses an sql database to update book details including quantity, add books to the database, select/search a specific book/books
by using the id, author, title of the book and even delte a book from the database.

Installation:

  To run the program you can simply use any IDE suitable for python(py) files and simply run it.  
  You also have the option to create a container via docker if that is more suitable for you.



How to Use the Program

  The program is like a database to store ebooks.  People may use it for their bookshop for example.
  This helps them run their bookshop more efficiently as they are able to search if any titles are avaialble whether they
  use the title, author or book idea. It can also update the quantity of the books. For example if someone buys a book or you have a shipment of books arrived,
  the user can easily update the quantity.  The program was made as user friend as possible for the users so they may be able to run their ebook/book business
  hassle-free.
